Abstract
Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific
journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network
and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of
“unrolling” an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the
essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive
the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN
unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN
into the “Vanilla LSTM”1 network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system
together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for
presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich
the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to
date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open
to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented
LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.},

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is more prevalent than T1D and management of T2D is more heterogeneous, requiring treatment ranging from lifestyle modiﬁcation to oral medications to intensive insulin therapy. Recent randomized controlled trials in intensively insulin-treated T2D demonstrated the efﬁcacy and safety of real-time CGM (rtCGM) in reducing glycated hemoglobin without increasing hypoglycemia. Although evidence is limited, early studies have indicated a role for rtCGM in selected patients with non-insulin requiring T2D to improve glycemic control and/or reduce hypoglycemia. Based on literature review, we summarized current data on the use of rtCGM in T2D management and provided future research direction to generate more evidence on the utility of CGM in this population.},

	abstract = {Background:In type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, short-term glucose prediction can allow to anticipate therapeutic decisions when hypo/hyperglycemia is imminent. Literature prediction methods mainly use past continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) readings. Sophisticated algorithms can use information on insulin delivered and meal carbohydrate (CHO) content. The quantification of how much insulin and CHO information improves glucose prediction is missing in the literature and is investigated, in an open-loop setting, in this proof-of-concept study.Methods:We adopted a versatile literature prediction methodology able to utilize a variety of inputs. We compared predictors that use (1) CGM; (2) CGM and insulin; (3) CGM and CHO; and (4) CGM, insulin, and CHO. Data of 15 T1D subjects in open-loop setup were used. Prediction was evaluated via absolute error and temporal gain focusing on meal/night periods. The relative importance of each individual input of the predictor was evaluated with a sensitivity analysis.Results:For a prediction horizon (PH) ≥ 30 minutes, insulin and CHO information improves prediction accuracy of 10\% and double the temporal gain during the 2 hours following the meal. During the night the 4 methods did not give statistically different results. When PH ≥ 45 minutes, the influence of CHO information on prediction is 5-fold that of insulin.Conclusions:In an open-loop setting, with PH ≥ 30 minutes, information on CHO and insulin improves short-term glucose prediction in the 2-hour time window following a meal, but not during the night. CHO information improves prediction significantly more than insulin.},

              People living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) require lifelong self-management to maintain glucose levels in a safe range. Failure to do so can lead to adverse glycemic events with short and long-term complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is widely used in T1D self-management for real-time glucose measurements, while smartphone apps are adopted as basic electronic diaries, data visualization tools, and simple decision support tools for insulin dosing. Applying a mixed effects logistic regression analysis to the outcomes of a six-week longitudinal study in 12 T1D adults using CGM and a clinically validated wearable sensor wristband (NCT ID: NCT03643692), we identified several significant associations between physiological measurements and hypo- and hyperglycemic events measured an hour later. We proceeded to develop a new smartphone-based platform, ARISES (Adaptive, Real-time, and Intelligent System to Enhance Self-care), with an embedded deep learning algorithm utilizing multi-modal data from CGM, daily entries of meal and bolus insulin, and the sensor wristband to predict glucose levels and hypo- and hyperglycemia. For a 60-minute prediction horizon, the proposed algorithm achieved the average root mean square error (RMSE) of 35.28 ± 5.77 mg/dL with the Matthews correlation coefficients for detecting hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia of 0.56 ± 0.07 and 0.70 ± 0.05, respectively. The use of wristband data significantly reduced the RMSE by 2.25 mg/dL (
              p
               {\textless} 0.01). The well-trained model is implemented on the ARISES app to provide real-time decision support. These results indicate that the ARISES has great potential to mitigate the risk of severe complications and enhance self-management for people with T1D.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
The inverse relationship between overall glucose control and hypoglycemia risk is
weakened by the use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM). We
assess the relationship between glucose control and hypoglycemia in people with
type 1 diabetes using multiple-dose injection (MDI) regimens, including those at
highest risk of hypoglycemia.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
CGM data from the intervention (rtCGM) and control (self-monitored blood glucose
[SMBG]) phases of the Multiple Daily Injections and Continuous Glucose
Monitoring in Diabetes (DIAMOND) and HypoDE studies were analyzed. The
relationship between glucose control (HbA1c and mean rtCGM glucose levels) and
percentage time spent in hypoglycemia was explored for thresholds of 3.9 mmol/L
(70 mg/dL) and 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL), and ANOVA across the range of HbA 1c and
mean glucose was performed.
RESULTS
A nonlinear relationship between mean glucose and hypoglycemia was identified at
baseline, with the steepest relationship seen at lower values of mean glucose. The
use of rtCGM reduces the exposure to hypoglycemia at all thresholds and flattens
the relationship between overall glucose and hypoglycemia, with the most marked
impact at lower values of mean glucose and HbA 1c. Exposure to hypoglycemia varied
at all thresholds across the range of overall glucose at baseline, in the SMBG group,
and with rtCGM, but the relationships were weaker in the rtCGM group.
CONCLUSIONS
Use of rtCGM can flatten and attenuate the relationship between overall glucose
control and hypoglycemia, exerting its greatest impact at lower values of HbA 1c and
mean glucose in people with type 1 diabetes using MDI regimens and at highest risk
of hypoglycemia.},

We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees.

Furthermore, the real-time availability of BG values has been stimulating the realization of new tools to provide patients with decision support to improve insulin dosage tuning and infusion. The aim of this paper is to offer an overview of current literature and future possible developments regarding CGM technologies and applications.

	abstract = {Continuous glucose monitorings (CGMs) have been used to manage diabetes with reasonable glucose control amongst patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in recent decades. CGMs measure interstitial fluid glucose levels to provide information about glucose levels, which identify fluctuation that would not have been identified with conventional self-monitoring. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a classical tool to measure glycaemic changes. However, the effectiveness of glucose control, hypoglycemia, weight change, quality of life and user satisfaction, are needed to evaluate and compare CGMs and SMBG amongst adults with T2D. The review will compare the various forms of CGM systems (i.e flash CGM, real-time CGM, retrospective CGM) versus SMBG or usual intervention regarding diabetes management amongst adults with T2D. The following databases will be searched: Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and grey literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, PsycEXTRA, ProQuest Dissertations, Google Scholar and Theses Global) for the identification of studies. The studies involving adults (aged ≥ 18 years old) will be included. We will only include and summarise randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with respect to authors, publication type, year, status and type of devices. Studies published in English between February 2010 and March 2020, will be included as the field of CGMs amongst T2D patients has emerged over the last decade. Primary outcomes will be HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin level) (mmol/L), body weight (kg), time spent with hypoglycaemia ({\textless} 70 mg/dl) or hyperglycaemia (≥ 180 mg/dl), blood pressure ({\textless} 140/90 mmHg is considered as good management) and quality of life (understanding and feeling of living situation based on culture and value system). Secondary outcome measures will be user satisfaction (patient or treatment/intervention satisfaction or satisfaction scale) and barriers (physical and mental difficulties or issues). Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be conducted independently by at least two reviewers. A third reviewer will determine and resolve discrepancies. Moreover, the quality of the evidence of the review will be assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool (GRADE). The review will synthesise evidence on the comparison between using CGMs and SMBG. The results will support researchers and health professionals to determine the most effective methods/technologies in the overall diabetes management. PROSPERO CRD42020149212},

We apply this new variational inference based dropout technique in LSTM and GRU models, assessing it on language modelling and sentiment analysis tasks. The new approach outperforms existing techniques, and to the best of our knowledge improves on the single model state-of-the-art in language modelling with the Penn Treebank (73.4 test perplexity). This extends our arsenal of variational tools in deep learning.},

	abstract = {Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves are commonly used to present results for binary decision problems in machine learning. However, when dealing with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall (PR) curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm’s performance. We show that a deep connection exists between ROC space and PR space, such that a curve dominates in ROC space if and only if it dominates in PR space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an eﬃcient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note diﬀerences in the two types of curves are signiﬁcant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

Although it is a challenging topic in data mining, it has been acquiring increasing attention due to its huge potential for immediate applications. In this paper, a new algorithm for time-series novelty detection based on one-class support vector machines (SVMs) is proposed. The concepts of phase and projected phase spaces are first introduced, which allows us to convert a time-series into a set of vectors in the (projected) phase spaces. Then we interpret novel events in time-series as outliers of the "normal" distribution of the converted vectors in the (projected) phase spaces. One-class SVMs are employed as the outlier detectors. In order to obtain robust detection results, a technique to combine intermediate results at different phase spaces is also proposed. Experiments on both synthetic and measured data are presented to demonstrate the promising performance of the new algorithm.},

	abstract = {Blood glucose (BG) management is crucial for type-1 diabetes patients resulting in the necessity of reliable artificial pancreas or insulin infusion systems. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been utilized for a more accurate BG level prediction system. However, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) readings are susceptible to sensor errors. As a result, inaccurate CGM readings would affect BG prediction and make it unreliable, even if the most optimal machine learning model is used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to predicting blood glucose level with a stacked Long short-term memory (LSTM) based deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model considering sensor fault. We use the Kalman smoothing technique for the correction of the inaccurate CGM readings due to sensor error. For the OhioT1DM (2018) dataset, containing eight weeks’ data from six different patients, we achieve an average RMSE of 6.45 and 17.24 mg/dl for 30 min and 60 min of prediction horizon (PH), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the leading average prediction accuracy for the ohioT1DM dataset. Different physiological information, e.g., Kalman smoothed CGM data, carbohydrates from the meal, bolus insulin, and cumulative step counts in a fixed time interval, are crafted to represent meaningful features used as input to the model. The goal of our approach is to lower the difference between the predicted CGM values and the fingerstick blood glucose readings—the ground truth. Our results indicate that the proposed approach is feasible for more reliable BG forecasting that might improve the performance of the artificial pancreas and insulin infusion system for T1D diabetes management.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

Features are extracted from the dataset using stacked autoencoders and the dataset is classiﬁed using softmax layer. Also, ﬁne tuning of the network is done using backpropagation in supervised fashion with the training dataset. However, the medical diagnosis involves the risk factors of wrong prediction; hence we have used evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, speciﬁcity and F1 - score for the evaluation of our model and have achieved better results.
Results: The proposed framework is experimented on Pima Indians Diabetes data which has 768 patient records with 8 attributes for each record. We achieved classiﬁcation accuracy of 86.26\%.
Conclusion: A stacked autoencoders based Deep Learning framework for classiﬁcation of Type 2 Diabetes data is proposed in this paper. This approach is experimented on UCI machine learning data and proved the outperformance over various existing classiﬁcation methods.},

	abstract = {Suppose you are given some data set drawn from an underlying probability distribution P and you want to estimate a “simple” subset S of input space such that the probability that a test point drawn from P lies outside of S equals some a priori specified value between 0 and 1.
            We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate a function f that is positive on S and negative on the complement. The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients are found by solving a quadratic programming problem, which we do by carrying out sequential optimization over pairs of input patterns. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of our algorithm.
            The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to the case of unlabeled data.},
